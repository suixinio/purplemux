Claude Code blocks on permission dialogs by default — for tool calls, file writes, and similar. purplemux catches those dialogs the moment they appear and routes them to whatever device you happen to be near.

## What gets intercepted

Claude Code fires a `Notification` hook for several reasons. purplemux only treats two notification types as permission prompts:

- `permission_prompt` — the standard "Allow this tool to run?" dialog
- `worker_permission_prompt` — the same thing from a sub-agent

Anything else (idle reminders, etc.) is ignored on the status side and won't flip the tab to **needs-input** or send a push.

## What happens when one fires

1. Claude Code emits a `Notification` hook. The shell script at `~/.purplemux/status-hook.sh` POSTs the event and notification type to the local server.
2. The server flips the tab's state to **needs-input** (amber pulse) and broadcasts the change over the status WebSocket.
3. The dashboard renders the prompt **inline in the timeline**, with the same options Claude offered — no modal, no context switch.
4. If you've granted notification permission, a Web Push and / or desktop notification fires for `needs-input`.

The Claude CLI itself is still waiting on stdin. purplemux is reading the prompt's options from tmux and forwarding your choice back when you pick one.

## How to answer

Three equivalent ways:

- **Click** the option in the timeline.
- **Press the number** — <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> — matching the option index.
- **Tap the push** on your phone, which deep-links straight to the prompt; pick from there.

Once you select, purplemux sends the input to tmux, the tab transitions back to **busy**, and Claude resumes mid-stream. You don't need to acknowledge anything else — the click *is* the acknowledgement.

{% call callout('tip', 'Consecutive prompts re-fetch automatically') %}
If Claude asks several questions in a row, the inline prompt re-renders with the new options as soon as the next `Notification` arrives. You don't need to dismiss the previous one.
{% endcall %}

## Mobile flow

With the PWA installed and notifications granted, Web Push fires whether the browser tab is open, in the background, or closed:

- The notification reads "Input Required" and identifies the session.
- Tapping it opens purplemux focused on that tab.
- The inline prompt is already rendered; pick an option with one tap.

This is the main reason to set up [Tailscale + PWA](/purplemux/docs/quickstart/#reach-it-from-your-phone) — it lets approvals follow you off the desk.

## When the options can't be parsed

In rare cases (a prompt that scrolled out of the tmux scrollback before purplemux could read it), the options list comes back empty. The timeline shows a "couldn't read the prompt" card and retries up to four times with backoff. If it still fails, switch to the **Terminal** mode for that tab and answer in the raw CLI — the underlying Claude process is still waiting.

## What about idle nudges?

Claude's other notification types — for example, idle reminders — still arrive at the hook endpoint. The server logs them but does not change tab state, send a push, or surface a UI prompt. This is intentional: only events that *block* Claude need your attention.

## What's next

- **[Session status](/purplemux/docs/session-status/)** — what the **needs-input** state means and how it's detected.
- **[Live session view](/purplemux/docs/live-session-view/)** — where the inline prompt is rendered.
- **[Browser support](/purplemux/docs/browser-support/)** — Web Push requirements (especially iOS Safari 16.4+).
